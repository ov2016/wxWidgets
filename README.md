PasswordEntryDialog
This is about as basic as it gets. There are no prompts to re-enter if you get it wrong. You must re-run the program. I'm not a 
professional programmer so I can't even guarantee the way I go about it is correct, but that being said, it seems to work.
If it helps you in your codeing, feel free to use it. NO GUARANTEES! ðŸ˜Ž
